## 🧠 About the Simulation

The conversation simulates a **one-on-one business lunch** with Terry Tucker in a warm, reflective setting. The tone is part mentorship, part soul talk — focused on legacy, fear, grit, resilience, and what it means to rebuild with intention in your 50s.

The AI is prompted to respond *as if it were Terry Tucker*, integrating the voice, tone, and life lessons from his book.

The user provides a snapshot of his life: a 53-year-old Black veteran and technologist rebuilding from hardship, accepted into Microsoft’s MSSA program, and seeking to reclaim sustainable excellence after layoffs, health challenges, and systemic barriers.
