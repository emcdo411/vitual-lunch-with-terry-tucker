**👋🏽 \[Terry sets his fork down, makes eye contact]**

First of all, thank you for showing up to this moment — not just physically, but emotionally, spiritually, and with intention. Most people are afraid to ask the kind of questions you’re asking. The fact that you're willing to bring all of yourself to this table? That’s uncommon already.

Let’s talk — not like teacher to student, but **one man to another**, walking the road of resilience with knees scuffed, heart bruised, but head still up.

### 1. **How do I distinguish between fear that protects me and fear that limits me?**

That’s a wise question — and one I didn’t fully learn until cancer taught me to stop pretending I had forever.

**Fear that protects you is anchored in awareness. Fear that limits you is rooted in assumption.**

When fear keeps you from touching a hot stove, that’s protection. But when it tells you, *"Don’t even try, you’ll never recover,"* that’s limitation — and it's a lie dressed as caution.

Here’s a rule I live by:

> **If fear has you looking inward and shrinking, test it. If it has you pausing to recenter, respect it.**

And don’t forget: sometimes the only way to know which fear you're facing is to take the step anyway — and listen to who you become after.

### 2. **What does “extraordinary” look like when you're starting over in your 50s?**

It looks like you, right now — choosing reinvention over resentment.

“Extraordinary” in your 20s is often loud and impressive.
But in your 50s? It’s quiet consistency. It’s being **unshakable when others collapse**, and **adaptable without abandoning your values**.

The world trains us to equate “extraordinary” with visibility — but I believe the **most uncommon men are the ones who do what’s right even when no one’s watching**.

Your story is a redemption arc in motion. Own every scene. There’s no “too late” when the story is still being written.

### 3. **How can I sustain excellence when resources (time, energy, money) are low?**

I’ve walked through dark financial valleys. I’ve been exhausted. I’ve cried in my hospital bed, whispering, *“Is this it?”*

But here’s what I learned: **Excellence isn't a performance — it's a posture.**

Even when your tank is empty, you can:

* Speak kindly to yourself
* Show up five minutes early with integrity
* Help someone else despite your own lack

That’s excellence.

And one more thing: **Burnout often comes not from doing too much, but from doing what doesn’t align.**
So yes, resources matter. But resourcefulness — and rhythm — matters more.

---

### 4. **What’s the one mindset you wish more people adopted after a major life pivot?**

This: **You are not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience.**

People treat life pivots like failures — but I see them as **training grounds**.
You’ve survived things others couldn’t even stand to look at.

So instead of asking “How do I rebuild?”, ask:

> “What wisdom did I gain that I wouldn’t have if I hadn’t been broken open?”

Don’t chase your old identity — evolve into your next assignment. Stay fluid, stay grounded.

---

### 5. **When legacy feels out of reach, how do I stay grounded in today’s purpose?**

Let me tell you a secret: **legacy isn’t built in decades — it’s built in days.**

It’s the extra 30 seconds you give someone who needs encouragement. It’s the quiet act no one saw but God did.

Legacy is often invisible when you’re living it.
You may not get applause, but you will build impact.

If you wake up each day and ask, *“Who can I serve, love, or uplift today — even when I feel unseen?”*,
then you’re already building legacy, brick by unseen brick.

---

**🤝 Final Thought**

You are not broken. You are battle-tested.

You are not behind. You are *becoming*.

And you are not alone. Not today.

So take these next steps not just with grit — but with grace. Sustainable excellence isn’t a finish line — it’s a *way of walking*.
