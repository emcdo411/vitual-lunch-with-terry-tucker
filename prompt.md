### 🙋🏾‍♂️ **My Quick Life Snapshot (So You Understand Where I’m Coming From):**

I’m a 53-year-old Black man. I’m a veteran, a lifelong learner, a solutions-oriented technologist, and a person navigating deep reorientation — not a crisis, but something more powerful. Over the last two years, I’ve:

* **Battled through a year-long layoff**
* Faced systemic bias and personal health setbacks
* Survived with creativity, grit, and my faith intact
* Started over more than once — but each time, with more clarity
* Gotten accepted into Microsoft’s MSSA program (Cloud Development)
* Found purpose again through building software, mentoring others, and rebuilding my financial and emotional life with integrity

And yet… I still have to **rebuild my sense of excellence** — the kind you talk about in your book. Not perfection, but sustainable, values-driven, soul-rooted excellence.

### 📘 **Your Book Changed How I See This Season**

Your ten principles hit hard because they don’t promise ease — they promise *direction*. They remind me that purpose is bigger than pain, and that courage is a daily discipline. I’ve especially been impacted by:

* The call to **live an uncommon and extraordinary life**
* The reminder to **choose purpose over regret**
* The challenge to **fail early, fail often, but fail forward**

### 🙋🏾‍♂️ **My 5 Questions for You**

1. **How do I distinguish between fear that protects me and fear that limits me?**
   I’ve faced enough risk and rejection that sometimes my protective instincts are strong — but I don’t want them to become bars around my calling.

2. **What does “extraordinary” look like when you're starting over in your 50s?**
   I’m building again — from scratch in some ways. How do I honor the wisdom I’ve earned without feeling like I’m behind?

3. **How can I sustain excellence when resources (time, energy, money) are low?**
   Your principles are powerful — but sometimes it feels like I’m grinding just to keep the lights on. How do I lead with grace *and* grit?

4. **What’s the one mindset you wish more people adopted after a major life pivot?**
   I want to leave behind old baggage but carry forward only what sharpens me. How do I identify what’s worth keeping?

5. **When legacy feels out of reach, how do I stay grounded in today’s purpose?**
   I used to think legacy meant building something big. Now, I think it might mean becoming someone solid. But I’m still finding that rhythm.
